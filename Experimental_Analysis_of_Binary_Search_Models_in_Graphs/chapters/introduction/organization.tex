\section{Organization of the work}
The second chapter serves as a more formal and detailed introduction necessary for further considerations. We formally restate all of the search models we are interested in and we recall the basic notions of graph theory required for the analysis.

The main part of the thesis is partitioned into two main chapters:

In the third chapter we focus ourselves on the formal analysis of the considered variants including the presentation of the most interesting algorithmic results for the problem. We showcase exact and approximation algorithms and few hardness results for the most complex variants of the search problem. 

The fourth chapter is a description of the computer experiments conducted in order to verify the theoretical claims regarding the performance of the previously presented algorithms.

The fifth chapter serves as a summary of our considerations and points the further research directions regarding this field.
