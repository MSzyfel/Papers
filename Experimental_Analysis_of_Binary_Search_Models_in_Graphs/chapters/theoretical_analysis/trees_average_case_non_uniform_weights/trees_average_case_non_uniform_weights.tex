\section{Average case, non-uniform weights}
The problem of average case searching is also solvable in polynomial time assuming all weights are uniform. However, the procedure is the same as for the weighted case and only the running time differs. Hence, we combine these results in one section. Note that it is yet unknown whether the weighted case can be solved in polynomial time or if it is NP-hard. For the latter problem, the fastest known algorithm runs in pseudopolynomial time. By combining it with a standard rounding trick one may also obtain an FPTAS. Before that, however, we show that a simple greedy heuristic achieves a 2-approximation for $T||V,w||\sum C_j$.
